# Stable vs Unstable Sorting Algorithms

## **Stable Sorting Algorithms**
- A sorting algorithm is **stable** if it **preserves the original order of equal elements**.

### Examples of Stable Algorithms:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Merge Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Counting Sort

## **Unstable Sorting Algorithms**
- An algorithm is **unstable** if it **can change the original order of equal elements**.

### Examples of Unstable Algorithms:
1. Quick Sort
2. Heap Sort
3. Selection Sort

## **Why Stability Matters**:
- Stability is important when sorting complex data, especially when sorting by multiple keys (e.g., sorting by age, then by name). Stable algorithms keep the relative order of equal elements, which can be crucial in such cases.

## **Key Differences**:
- **Stable Sort**: Keeps equal items in their original order.
- **Unstable Sort**: May reorder equal items.
