## Linear Search

Linear Search is the simplest way to find an item in a list. It works by checking each item in the list one by one until it finds the target item or reaches the end of the list. Even though it's not the fastest method, it's easy to understand and can be used on any list, whether sorted or unsorted.

### Steps to Perform Linear Search

1. **Start from the beginning**:
   - Begin by looking at the first item in the list.

2. **Check each item**:
   - Compare the current item with the target item you're searching for.

3. **Move to the next item**:
   - If the current item is not the target, move on to the next item in the list.

4. **Repeat**:
   - Continue this process, comparing each item one by one.

5. **Find the target or reach the end**:
   - If you find the target item, stop and return its index.
   - If you reach the end of the list without finding the target, conclude that the item isn't in the list.

6. **End**:
   - The search is complete when you find the item or have checked every item in the list.
