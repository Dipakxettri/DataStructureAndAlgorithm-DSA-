# Time completely of linear Search

## Best Case:
O(1) - constant - 1 comparisons 
- **1**: if target elements in the first index
- **2**: only 1 comparisons in best case
- **3**: size of Array don't matters
- **4**: in best vase it makes only 1 comparison 

## worst case:
O(n) - N means size of array
- **1**: we don't find target elements 
- **2**: iterate/go throw every items and then in the end it says element not found 
- **3**: in worst case it makes size of array number of comparisons
