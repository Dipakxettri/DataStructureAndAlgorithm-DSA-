# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

## Data Structures

Data structures are ways to organize and store data efficiently. Common types include:

- **Arrays**: A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.
- **Linked Lists**: A series of elements where each element points to the next.
- **Stacks**: A collection of elements with Last In, First Out (LIFO) access.
- **Queues**: A collection of elements with First In, First Out (FIFO) access.
- **Trees**: Hierarchical structures with nodes, where each node has a value and pointers to other nodes.
- **Graphs**: Structures consisting of nodes and edges connecting them.

## Algorithms

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. Common types include:

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Techniques to arrange data in a specific order (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort).
- **Searching Algorithms**: Techniques to find specific data (e.g., Binary Search).
- **Traversal Algorithms**: Techniques to visit all nodes in a data structure (e.g., Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search).

## Why Learn DSA?

Understanding DSA helps in writing efficient code, optimizing performance, and solving complex problems. It's essential for programming interviews and real-world problem-solving.
